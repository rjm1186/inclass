As an 18-year-old originally from Kittery, Maine, I've embarked on an exciting new chapter of my life at the University of New Hampshire. A proud graduate of Traip Academy, I've transitioned smoothly into college life, bringing with me the strong foundation and small-town values that shaped my early years.
My passion for understanding complex economic systems has led me to pursue a major in Analytical Economics, where I'm excited to dive deep into the intricate world of data-driven economic analysis and explore how numbers can tell powerful stories about human behavior and market dynamics. I'm currently exploring potential minors that could complement my major, eager to broaden my academic horizons and create a unique educational pathway that sets me apart in the competitive world of economics.
My time at UNH has been nothing short of incredible. I've been blown away by the campus energy, the diverse group of friends I've made, and the awesome opportunities for personal growth. The professors in the economics department are legit - they're not just teaching from textbooks, but sharing real-world insights that get me pumped about my future career. I've already joined the Economics Club and have been networking with upperclassmen who've given me killer advice about internships and career paths. The campus facilities are amazing, from the state-of-the-art library to the killer recreation center where I work out and blow off steam between study sessions. Durham itself is such a cool college town, and I'm loving every minute of discovering what college life is all about.    </aside>
